/**
 * Exception thrown if a callback refers to an undefined method or if some arguments are missing. It's a logic exception.
 * 
 * Basically, this is what you would throw if your code messes up and for example a sanity-check finds a value 
 * is outside the domain. For example, if you have a method which performs weekday calculations, and for some 
 * reason a result of a calculation is outside the 1-7 range (for days in a week), you could throw a DomainException. 
 * This is because the value is outside the domain for day numbers in a week.
 *
