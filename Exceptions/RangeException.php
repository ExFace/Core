/**
 * Exception thrown to indicate range errors during program execution (runtime).
 * 
 * This is an exception that should be thrown when a value is out of some specific range. Normally this 
 * means there was an arithmetic error other than under/overflow. Its similar to DomainException in its 
 * intended purpose, but it should be used in cases where the error is going to be caused in a runtime scenario.
