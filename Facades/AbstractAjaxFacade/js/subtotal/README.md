# Subtotal.js

[Subtotal.js](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal) is a JavaScript plugin for [PivotTable.js](https://pivottable.js.org/examples/). It renders rows and columns of a pivot table with subtotals and lets the user expand or collapse rows and columns.


Subtotal.js is available under an MIT license from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/subtotal) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) under the name `subtotal`. On [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/nagarajanchinnasamy/subtotal), it is `nagarajanchinnasamy/subtotal`.

## Where can I see the demo?

You can see the live demo at [examples page](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal/examples/index.html).

## How can I get started?

To know how to load and use this library, please refer to [Getting Started Wiki Page](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/subtotal/wiki/Getting-Started)

## API Documentation?

Please refer to [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/subtotal/wiki)

## How can I build the code and run the tests?

To install the development dependencies, just run `npm install`, which will create a `node_modules` directory with the files required to run the [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) build system.

After modifying any of the `.coffee` files at the top of the repo, you can compile/minify the files into the `dist` directory by running `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js`

Once that's done, you can point your browser to `tests/index.html` to run the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) test suite. You can view the [current test results here](http://nagarajanchinnasamy.com/subtotal/tests).

The easiest way to modify the code and work with the examples is to leave a `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js watch serve` command running, which will automatically compile the CoffeeScript files when they are modified and will also run a local web server you can connect to to run the tests and examples.

## How can I contribute?

Pull requests are welcome! Here are some [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/nagarajanchinnasamy/subtotal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
