 * A menu widget shows one or more button groups rendered as a menu.

 * The menu is very similarly to the Toolbar except for it's visual appearance.
 * 
 * The menu itself is just a list of buttons, but it can be used in other widgets
 * like a MenuButton (resulting in a dropdown-menu) or a data widget (resulting
 * in a context-menu).
