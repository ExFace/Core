Since the alias of the right object is used in relation paths for reverse relations, there can easily be multiple reverse relations with the same alias. \n\nConsider the following example with a meta object ORDER, which has two different relations to the object COMPANY: PAYEE and CONTRACTOR. The expression COMPANY__ORDER (all order of a company) is ambiguous, because it is unclear, which relation is meant, so the correct notation would be COMPANY__ORDER[PAYEE] or COMPANY__ORDER[CONTRACTOR]. \n\nThe part in square brackets is called *modifier* and is required for reverse relations, unless one of the following conditions applies:\n\n- There is only one relation from the right to the left object (e.g. if there would be only one relation from ORDER to COMPANY)\n- There are multiple relations, but only one of them is required for the right object (e.g. only PAYEE would be required for ORDER) - in this case, the required relations is used by default.\n\nIn any case, the full notation with the modifier is allways possible. The short one is just a convenience shortcut.\n\n",
