# Release history

## 1.0 (in development)

First stand-alone release without the dependency on an external CMS-system.

## 0.x

Before version 1.0, the workbench relied on an external CMS system, that would provide frontend-rendering, routing, menus and access permissions to those things. The CMS was attached using a special connector, like the `ModxCmsConnector` for the Evolution CMS (formally MODx Evolution).
