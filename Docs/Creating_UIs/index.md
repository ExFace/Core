# Creating UIs

The UI consists of a hierarchy of pages, each containing widgets. You can describe the widgets to be show on a page using UXON - **U**ser e**X**perience **N**otation **O**bjects - a structured UI description language. Here is an [introduction](UXON/index.md) to it's main concepts.

## Quick links
- [Getting started with the UXON language](UXON/index.md)
- [Creating a simple DataTable](Data_Tables/creating_basic_datatables.md)
- [Creating an editor-dialog for an object](Forms_and_inputs/Editor-dialogs_for_objects.md)

If you prefer real-world examples, take a look at the administration pages (Administration > Metamodel). You open these pages in the editor just like any other UI page. They are a great source of examples to get familiar with typical data tables, editors, etc.
