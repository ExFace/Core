# Creating metamodels

## Modelling data

### Data sources, supported out-of-the-box

- [SQL databases](data_sources/SQL/index.md)
- Files and Folders
- [Web services](https://github.com/exface/UrlDataConnector/blob/master/Docs/index.md)
- Source code

### Using data in other parts of the model

Other entities of the meta model like actions, widgets, etc. will use the data. In general, any model entity can be referenced by its alias and the app alias as namespace if the entity belongs to an app - see [Expressions](Expressions_and_formulas.md) for more information. 

## Access permissions and user-specific settings

You can override any data connection settings on user-level by creating [credential sets](Data_connection_credentials_and_user-specific_settings.md) and assigning them to users.
