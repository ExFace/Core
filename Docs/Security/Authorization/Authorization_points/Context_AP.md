# Context authorization point

This authorization point controls the access to [contexts and the context bar](../../developers_docs/Contexts/index.php). The policies for built-int contexts are already set by default. You only need to add policies for this authorization point if new custom contexts are added or (more unlikely) you need to change the behavior of the built-in contexts.

## Permissions for custom contexts

By default, contexts are only visible to superusers (role `exface.Core.SUPERUSER`).
