## Page authorization point

TODO

**NOTE:** In contrast to other authorization points, this one will grant access if the regular decision is `not applicable` or `indeterminate` in case the page was created by the user requesting access. This makes sure, users have access to a new page immediately after creating it. It also ensures, that a user "sees" his own unpublished pages no matter what policies apply to his or her account.
