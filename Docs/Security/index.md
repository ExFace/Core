## Overview

The security system of the workbench takes care of two things:

- [Authentication](Authentication/index.md) (logging on, verifying the user)
- [Authorization](Authorization/index.md) (defining and validating access permissions to various parts of the model and logic)

All the administrative tools related to security can be found in the main menu at `Administration > Users & Security`.
