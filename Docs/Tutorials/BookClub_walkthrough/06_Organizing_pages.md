# Organizing pages in the menu

## 1. Create a submenu for the app

The first thing to do is creating the root page for our app:

1. Go to `Administration > Pages` in the main menu. Here you see an editable version of the menu tree with lots of additional information about each page.
2. Select the root node `Home` (alias `index`) at the top. 
3. Press `+ New` to create a new page as a child-node of the selected `Home` page. Selecting the parent menu node is far more comfortable than searching for it in the page editor afterwards.
4. Fill the fields in the tab `Page Properties` as follows:
	- Page name: `Book Club`
	- Page alias: leave blank - it will be generated automatically
	- Published: yes
	- Is part of app: `tutorial.BookClub`
5. Switch to tab `Widget`
