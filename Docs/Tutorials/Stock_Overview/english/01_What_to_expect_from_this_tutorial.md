In this tutorial, you will learn some fundamental basics for the elements PowerUI offers GUI designers. It’s recommended to read the theoretical information pages and the documentation in the 4D1 Wiki. This tutorial requires access to the PowerUI Spielwiese: [Home](https://sdrexf2.salt-solutions.de/powerui-spielwiese/)

**This tutorial will not:**  
- Explain every aspect in great detail; that’s what the Wiki pages are for.  
- Show you how PowerUI is programmed, we will not cover the core devs tasks (PHP etc.).  
- Teach you knowledge of databases, how they work, or train you in SQL.  

**What this tutorial will do:**  
- Show you a few more PowerUI elements than the BookClub Tutorial did.  
- Explain in a bit more detail how these elements are connected.  
- Give you practical exercises to create or adjust a page.  
- Will ask you questions here and there to activate your own thought process.  

The goal is to train your transfer knowledge and to show you a few more functionalities so you can recreate them, no matter what the actual input for your task is.

### Things to do before starting the PowerUI Tutorial: Stock Overview

Before starting the PowerUI Tutorial: Stock Overview, make sure you have successfully finished the BookClub Tutorial. The two tutorials aren’t based on the same database, but the BookClub Tutorial establishes the basic information for data sources and data connections. Additionally, in the BookClub tutorial you will have handled some SQL – while this tutorial already has a database you won’t modify, you will need some basic SELECT statements to understand the relations between several tables.  

You need to have downloaded SQL Server Management Studio and have a functional connection to swusqllogbase.salt-solutions.de.  

The goal is to get to know more functions for PowerUI – hence, this tutorial will introduce more elements for building a graphic user interface.  

Mainly the following:  
- Create a page  
- Create and edit buttons (actions)  
- Table relations: Attributes and columns  
- Table relations: Filters  
- Sorters  
- Rinse & Repeat: Relations, attributes, columns and filters  
- Interacting tables  
- Behaviors

What’s the goal for the page you will create? It’s to practice implementing some more PowerUI elements and understand how they all work together. It’s advised to read these pages [Grundlegende Begriffe - 4D1 Projektwikis - Confluence](https://asgixpo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/4d1prjwikis/pages/966164529/Grundlegende+Begriffe) if you don’t know what to do in this tutorial at any step. The info-pages were created alongside the tutorial, so they should cover all necessary explanations to follow through with the tutorial's instructions.
