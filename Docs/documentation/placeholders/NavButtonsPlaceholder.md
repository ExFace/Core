## NavButtons Placeholder

The `NavButtons` placeholder inserts "Previous" and "Next" navigation buttons based on the file order within the same directory.  
The order is determined by both **numerical** and **alphabetical** sorting of the filenames.

- It allows navigation to the **previous** and **next** files relative to the current file.
- Sorting is done first numerically (e.g., `1. Intro`, `1.1 Usage`), then alphabetically (e.g., `GettingStarted`, `Overview`).
- This placeholder does **not** support any options.

### Example Usage

```html
<!-- BEGIN NavButtons: -->
<!-- END NavButtons -->
 ```
