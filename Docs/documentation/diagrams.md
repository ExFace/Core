# Drawing diagrams

Diagrams help undertand processes a lot. Whenever a business process or a technical sequence is described in the docs, it is a good idea to add a diagram. In order to keep all diagrams homogenous and easy to understand, UML 2.0 should be used if possible.

## Diagramming tools

[PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/) is the recommended tool to create UML diagrams. It is free to use and works with plain text sources, that can be easily versioned together with the actual diagrams. There are plenty of plugins for various editors and even web browsers. Here are those used by the core team:

- [Eclipse plugin](http://plantuml.com/eclipse)
- [Google Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plantuml-viewer/legbfeljfbjgfifnkmpoajgpgejojooj)

All diagrams in the default documentation are located in Docs/diagrams: each as a .puml source file and an equally named .png file. Although this approach is not required, it has proven a good choice and is worth a recommendation.

## Diagram types

As a rule of thumb, use simpler diagrams like the acitivity (process flow) diagram for business processes and more specific ones like the class or sequence diagram in technical documentation.
